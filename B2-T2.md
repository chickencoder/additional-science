## Respiration

Respiration is the process used by all living organisms to release energy from
organic molecules - which is usually glucose.

More simply, respiration is how __all__ living things get energy from food.

Or even... Respiration is breaking down glucose to release energy.

#### Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration is respiration which uses *oxygen* and is the most effective method for releasing glucose.

```
  Glucose + Oxygen -> Carbon dioxide + Water (+ Energy)
```

###### Raw materials and waste diffuse in and out of the blood.
* The *circulatory* system carries glucose, oxygen and carbon dioxide around the body inside the blood.
* The glucose, which is used in respiration, come from the *digestive* system.
* The oxygen comes from the air breathed into our lungs.
* The carbon dioxide is breathed out.

* Glucose, oxygen etc. diffusing into and out of the cells via the capillaries.
* These materials are transferred by the process of __diffusion__.

```
Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
```

* The bigger the difference in concentration, the faster the rate of diffusion.

###### When you exercise more, you respire more.
When you exercise, your muscles contract more meaning you need more energy. Therefore, your breathing rate is increased so that more oxygen can get to your cells for respiration. Your heart rate will also increase to increase the rate that carbon dioxide is removed - all to speed up the rate respiration.

However, your body can only increase its efficiency to a certain amount. Once it is respiring at its quickest speed, aerobic respiration no longer becomes an option.

#### Anaerobic Respiration
Anaerobic respiration occurs when there is not enough oxygen in your blood.
Instead, glucose is quickly converted into lactic acid.

```
Glucose -> Lactic Acid (+ energy)
```

Anaerobic respiration does not produces as much energy as aerobic respiration. Instead it produces lactic acid which can cause cramp.

In effect, once you have stopped exercising, you owe your body the oxygen it needed. This is known as __oxygen debt__.
The amount required is called the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption
(or EPOC). The time taken to gain back this oxygen is the time you may need after exercise for your breathing to return to your post-exercise rate.

## Photosynthesis
"Plant's way of making their own food."

Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of a leaf cell which contains chlorophyll. The chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.

Leaves are adapted for efficient photosynthesis with a broad, large surface area, chlorophyll and small holes called *stomata* which allow gases in and out.

Photosynthesis is limited by..
1. Light intensity
2. concentration of carbon dioxide
3. temperature
