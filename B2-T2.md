## Respiration

Respiration is the process used by all living organisms to release energy from
organic molecules - which is usually glucose.

More simply, respiration is how __all__ living things get energy from food.

Or even... Respiration is breaking down glucose to release energy.

#### Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration is respiration which uses *oxygen* and is the most effective method for releasing glucose.

```
  Glucose + Oxygen -> Carbon dioxide + Water (+ Energy)
```

###### Raw materials and waste diffuse in and out of the blood.
* The *circulatory* system carries glucose, oxygen and carbon dioxide around the body inside the blood.
* The glucose, which is used in respiration, come from the *digestive* system.
* The oxygen comes from the air breathed into our lungs.
* The carbon dioxide is breathed out.

* Glucose, oxygen etc. diffusing into and out of the cells via the capillaries.
* These materials are transferred by the process of __diffusion__.

```
Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area
of high concentration to an area of low
concentration.
```

* The bigger the difference in concentration, the faster the rate of diffusion.

###### When you exercise more, you respire more.
When you exercise, your muscles contract more meaning you need more energy. Therefore, your breathing rate is increased so that more oxygen can get to your cells for respiration. Your heart rate will also increase to increase the rate that carbon dioxide is removed - all to speed up the rate respiration.

However, your body can only increase its efficiency to a certain amount. Once it is respiring at its quickest speed, aerobic respiration no longer becomes an option.

#### Anaerobic Respiration
Anaerobic respiration occurs when there is not enough oxygen in your blood.
Instead, glucose is quickly converted into lactic acid.

```
Glucose -> Lactic Acid (+ energy)
```

Anaerobic respiration does not produces as much energy as aerobic respiration. Instead it produces lactic acid which can cause cramp.

In effect, once you have stopped exercising, you owe your body the oxygen it needed. This is known as __oxygen debt__.
The amount required is called the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption
(or EPOC). The time taken to gain back this oxygen is the time you may need after exercise for your breathing to return to your post-exercise rate.

## Photosynthesis
"Plant's way of making their own food."

Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of a leaf cell which contains chlorophyll. The chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.

Leaves are adapted for efficient photosynthesis with a broad, large surface area, chlorophyll and small holes called *stomata* which allow gases in and out.

Photosynthesis is limited by..
1. Light intensity
2. concentration of carbon dioxide
3. temperature

## Osmosis
__Osmosis__ is the movement of water particles across a partially permeable membrane. This is due to diffusion of water moving across a concentration gradient.

A *partially permeable* membrane has small holes in it. This means water can moves in and out of the membrane.

## Water in plants

Roots have millions of root hairs covering their surface. Root hairs take in water by *osmosis*. Having such a large surface area means plants can take in as much water as possible.

Root hairs also absorb minerals. Diffusion won't usually absorb the minerals into the roots so __active transport is required__. Active transport uses the plant's energy, released in respiration, to pull minerals from the soil.

## Transpiration
Transpiration is the loss of water from a plant. This is caused by the evaporation and diffusion of water in the leaves. This prompts the plant to re-fill its leaves with water. The water is transported up the __xylem vessels__ to replace the lost water.

## Collecting samples of the distribution of organisms
1. __Pooters__ - collect ground insects. Pooters are just jars with two straws: one to suck air out and one to collect the insect.
2. __Pitfall Traps__ - collect ground insects. Pitfall traps are simply holes in the ground to catch insects. They are easy to enter but difficult to leave.
3. __Sweep Nets__ - collect animals from long grass.
4. __Pond Nets__ - collect animals from ponds.
5. __Quadrat__ - is used to study the frequency of small organisms in a given area. A quadrat is a square frame which makes it easier to count organisms in a small area.
