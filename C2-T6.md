## Relative Formula Mass
Essentially, the relative formula mass (M<sub>r</sub>) is the all relative atomic masses of each atom in a formula added together. So, the M<sub>r</sub> for magnesium chloride is...

**MgCl<sub>2</sub>**

24 + (35.5 x 2) = 95

It's as simple as that!

## Two formula mass calculations
#### Calculating % composition by mass of elements in a compound
This is finding out how much of a particular element is in a certain compound.

#### Finding th empirical formula
Follow this process:
1. List all of the elements in the compound
2. Below, write their experimental masses
3. Divide each mass by their A<sub>r</sub>
4. Turn the numbers into a nice ratio
5. When the ratio is its simplest form, you'll have the empirical formula.

## Calculating masses in reactions
1. Write out the balance equation
2. Work out the M<sub>r</sub> - just for the two bits you want
3. Apply the rule: Divide to get one, then multiply to get all.

Example: what is the mass of magnesium oxide produced when 60g of magnesium is burned in air?

1. 2Mg + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2MgO
2. 2 x 24 -> 2 x (24 + 16)
   48     -> 80
3. So 48g of Magnesium reacts to make 80g of magnesium oxide so..
  divide 80/48 to find what 1g of magnesium produces and then times by 60.

## Percentage Yield
Percentage yield compares the actual and theoretical yields.

Yields are always less than 100%. This is due to incomplete reactions, practical losses during preparation and unwanted reactions.

Waste in reactions costs money since it can be difficult to dispose of because it may be harmful.
