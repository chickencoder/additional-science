## Atoms

Atoms make up *everything*.

#### The Structure of an Atom
1. Nucleus
  * Made up of protons and neutrons
  * Has an overall **positive** charge
  * Very small compared to the entire atom
2. Electrons
  * Move around the nucleus
  * Have a **negative** charge
  * Have virtually no mass
  * Occupy shells around the atom

The number of *protons* is always equal to the number of *electrons*
The number of *neutrons* is usually similar to the number of *protons* but are not fixed.

| Particle | Relative Mass | Relative charge |
|----------|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| Proton   | 1             | +1              |
| Neutron  | 1             | 0               |
| Electron | 1/2000        | -1              |

## Electron shells
Electrons **always** occupy shells. The lowest energy levels are always filled first. These are the ones closest to the nucleus. In the first shell there are only 2 electrons and for the rest there are 8.

Atoms prefer full shells.

In most atoms the outer shell is not full which makes the atoms want to *react*.

#### Working out electronic configuration
In this example we'll use Nitrogen.

1. Nitrogen has 7 protons and therefore 7 electrons.
2. Using the rules of the shells (2, 8, 8...) fill the shells with electrons and then write the number of electrons in each shell like this: 2.5 (this says there are 2 in the first shell and 5 in the second).

## Elements
Elements are types of atoms. For example, Copper or Iron and so on. Each element has a different number of *protons*.

Each element has an **atomic number** and a **mass number**.
* The **atomic number** states how many protons there are in an atom and is unique to each element.
* The **mass number** is the number of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus. So to find the number of neutrons in an element, just subtract the **atomic number** from the **mass number**.

## Isotopes and Relative Atomic Mass
Isotopes are different versions of atoms with an extra neutron or two. Some elements have more than one isotope.

Relative atomic mass (A<sub>r</sub>) takes into account the different isotopes of an element as well.

Relative abundance is simply *how much* there is of each isotope compared to the total amount of that element in the world.
For example chlorine has two isotopes: <sup>35</sup>Cl and <sup>37</sup>Cl. The first of which has an abundance of 3 and the other has an abundance of 1 meaning for every 3x <sup>35</sup>Cl there is 1x <sup>37</sup>Cl.

To work out the relative atomic mass...
1. Times each isotope's relative mass but its relative abundance.
2. Add the sums for each isotope together.
3. Divide by the sum of the relative abundances.

## A brief history of the periodic table
In the 1800s scientists didn't know much about the structure of atoms but they did know how to calculate their relative atomic mass. When they ordered the known elements by their A<sub>r</sub>, scientists began to see patterns. He left gaps in his table.

* Mendeleev arranged elements in groups by their similar chemical properties.
* Mendeleev predicted new elements by the gaps in his table.

## The periodic table
The periodic table shows elements in order of their atomic numbers.

Metals and non-metals are on opposite ends of the table.

The table is arranged in periods and groups.
* Periods
  * Rows across the table
  * Increasing in atomic number
  * Properties change as you go along the row
* Groups
  * Columns down the table
  * Elements in the same group have similar properties because they have the same amount of electrons in their outer shells.
