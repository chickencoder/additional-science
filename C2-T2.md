## Ionic Bonding
Atoms of different elements can join together to form chemical bonds and join together to make new compounds. This can be achieved by ionic bonding...

Ionic bonding is when atoms transfer electrons to form positively or negatively charged **ions**.

A shell with *one* electron is keen to get rid of it..
A shell which is nearly full is keen to get another electron.

A classic example of this is the reaction of sodium and chlorine:
In this case, sodium has a nearly empty shell so it gives up its electron to chlorine which has a nearly full shell. Here we are left with an ion including Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>.

#### Groups 1, 2, 6 & 7 are most likely to form ions.
* Elements in group 1 and 2 are metals and they **loose** electrons to form cations (positively charged).
* Elements in group 6 and 7 are non-metals and they **gain** electrons to form anions (negatively charged).

When anions and cations join, they form **ionic bonds**.

## Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds all form in a similar way.
All atoms end up with a **full outer shell** when in an ionic compound.

Ionic compounds have a regular lattice structure. This means they're closely packed. This is because ionic bonds have very strong forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions.

Ionic compounds also have high boiling points and melting points. This is because its takes a large amount of energy to break their strong ionic bonds.

Ionic compounds conduct electricity when they are aqueous(dissolved) or molten. This is because in these states, the ions separate and are free to move around.

## Naming compounds
When two different elements combine the compounds name will be something-ide. When three or more compounds combine and one of them in oxygen, the compound's name will be something-ate.

## Working out the formula of an ionic compound
We can work out the formula of an ionic compound by looking at their charges. If an anion and a cation will form an ionic compound, their charges must balance (become zero).

For example, you need one hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>) to balance one sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) so the formula would be NaOH.

You need 2 Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to balance a Mg<sup>2+</sup> so the formula would be MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

## Preparing insoluble salts
The rules of solubility...

| Substance                                    | Soluble?           |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| common salts of potassium, sodium & ammonium | :white_check_mark: |
| nitrates                                     | :white_check_mark: |
| common chlorides (except silver & lead)      | :white_check_mark: |
| common sulfates                              | :white_check_mark: |
| common carbonates and hydroxides             | :x:                |

#### Making insoluble salts - precipitation
Using the right combination of soluble salts, we can produce an insoluble salt with a precipitation reaction.

E.g. to make lead chloride we can react lead nitrate and sodium chloride.

```
lead nitrate + sodium chloride -> lead chloride + sodium nitrate
```

1. Dissolve lead nitrate into distilled water.
2. Do the same for the sodium chloride.
3. Pour both into a small beaker and wait for the lead chloride to
precipitate out.
4. Filter out the precipitate using a funnel and filter paper into a conical flask.

## Barium Metals
Barium sulfate is an insoluble salt and is used for x-rays. This is because it is opaque to x-rays so it can be used to show any health problems in your gut. Barium is **toxic** but since it isn't soluble, it won't be absorbed into your bloodstream. When patients drink barium sulfate it is known as a **barium meal**.

## Flame Tests
* Sodium ions give a yellow/orange flame.
* Potassium ions give a lilac flame.
* Calcium ions give a red flame.
* Copper ions give a blue/green flame.

To test.. use a clean wire loop which you can clean with hydrochloric acid and then by rinsing it in distilled water.

## Testing for negative ions
* Testing for carbonates
  * Test for carbon dioxide by bubbling it through limewater. If the limewater turns cloudy then carbon dioxide is present.
  * This will test for carbonates if we react our solution with dilute acid since this will release the carbon dioxide.
* Test for sulfates and chlorides
  * To test for sulfate ions add dilute HCl and barrium chloride solution and if a white precipitate is present, so are sulfate ions.
  * To test for chloride ions, add dilute nitric acid followed by silver nitrate solution. If a precipitate is produced, then chloride  ions are present.

## Spectroscopy
Spectroscopy can be used to identify elements by the light patterns emitted in a heated sample. Each element produces a different pattern.
