## Evidence for Evolution
The theory of evolution says that over 3 million years ago, life began as simple organisms which have evolved into more complex organisms.

#### Evidence...
1. Fossils provide lots of evidence for evolution because they are living records of organisms from millions of years ago.
2. The pentadactyl limb is essentially a limb with five digits (like a hand). This provides evidence for evolution since many organisms have this feature but with a different function meaning that they must have a common ancestor.

## Growth and Development
Growth is an increase in size and mass.

You can measure growth in three ways...
1. Size - measuring an organism's height, length, width or circumference
2. Wet mass - measuring the amount of water an organism contains.
3. Dry mass - measuring the mass not including the water contained in the organism.

Growth can involve cells differentiating (becoming a different cell), cell division (cells multiplying) and cell elongation (cells becoming larger).

In animals growth is caused by cell division.

In plants growth is caused by differentiation and elongation.

## Cell Organisation and the Circulatory System
Cells, in multicellular organisms are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems.

A tissue is a group of similar cells that work together to do a particular job.

An organ is a group of different tissues that work together to do a particular job.

An organ system is a group of organs working together to do a particular job.

#### The Heart
* The heart has __4__ chambers and __4__ major blood vessels.
* The *right* atrium receives deoxygenated blood (from body) via the vena cava.
* The blood (deoxygenated) then travels to the right ventricle and then to the lungs.
* The *left* atrium receives oxygenated blood (from lungs) via the pulmonary vein.
* The oxygenated blood is then pumped round the entire body via the aorta.

* Valves prevent back-flow of blood.


#### The Blood

**Red Blood Cells** carry oxygen in the blood. They have a unique shape which gives them a large surface area so that they can carry plenty of oxygen. They don't have a nucleus.

**White Blood Cells** defend against disease. They can change shape to consume unwelcome microorganisms. They produce antibodies to fight microorganisms and antitoxins to neutralise toxins produced by microorganisms.

**Platelets** are small fragments of cells which help to create blood clots at a wound.

**Plasma** contains the "other stuff" found in the blood like glucose, urea, hormones etc. and also transports water and carbon dioxide.

#### Blood Vessels
There are three types of blood vessels
1. **Arteries** - carry blood away from the heart and to the body.
   They have thick walls and carry the blood at high pressure.
2. **Veins** - carry blood to the heart and away from the body.
   They have thin walls and carry the blood at low pressure.
3. **Capillaries** - involved in the exchange of materials with tissues. They have permeable walls so materials can diffuse into and out of cells.

## The Digestive System and Enzymes
Digestion is the breakdown food into soluble products to be absorbed by the body.

The breakdown of food is catalysed by enzymes.

* **Carbohydrases** (e.g. amylase) digest starch to sugars.
* **Proteases** (e.g. pepsin) digest proteins into amino acids.
* **Lipase** digest fat to fatty acids and glycerol.

During the digestion process, enzymes are used in various places...
1. **Mouth** - The salivary glands produce amylase enzymes in the saliva which breaks down starch. The food is turned into a ball called a bolus.
2. **Oesophagus** - Tube that takes food from the mouth to the stomach. Muscles push food down (peristalsis).
3. **Stomach** - mixes the food with acid and more enzymes.
4. **Small Intestine** - Enzymes from the pancreas are added here further digesting the larger molecules of food. Bile is also added in to aid the digestion of fats and is stored in the gall bladder.
5. **Large Intestine** - The remaining food molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream leaving poop :poop: which is then taken out of the body via the anus.

Peristalsis involves longitudinal and circular muscles.

#### Bile neutralises the stomach acid and emulsifies fats
Bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gall bladder.
It breaks down fats into small droplets. This gives a much greater surface area making it easier for the lipase enzymes to work.

#### Villi
Villi are like tiny little hairs on the inside of the small intestine. They absorb food into the bloodstream very efficiently because...
1. they have a large surface area
2. they have single layer of cells so diffusions occurs quickly
3. they have a very good blood supply because of the large amount of capillaries inside them meaning they can absorb food quickly.

## Functional Foods
A functional food is a food which has some kind of health benefit.

**Probiotics** are live live bacteria. These are good.

**Prebiotics** are carbohydrates that we can't digest. Prebiotics are food for good bacteria.

**Plant stanol esters** reduce cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease as they convert sterols (type of fat found in plants like soya beans) into stanols.
