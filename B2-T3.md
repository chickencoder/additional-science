## Evidence for Evolution
The theory of evolution says that over 3 million years ago, life began as simple organisms which have evolved into more complex organisms.

#### Evidence...
1. Fossils provide lots of evidence for evolution because they are living records of organisms from millions of years ago.
2. The pentadactyl limb is essentially a limb with five digits (like a hand). This provides evidence for evolution since many organisms have this feature but with a different function meaning that they must have a common ancestor.

## Growth and Development
Growth is an increase in size and mass.

You can measure growth in three ways...
1. Size - measuring an organism's height, length, width or circumference
2. Wet mass - measuring the amount of water an organism contains.
3. Dry mass - measuring the mass not including the water contained in the organism.

Growth can involve cells differentiating (becoming a different cell), cell division (cells multiplying) and cell elongation (cells becoming larger).

In animals growth is caused by cell division.

In plants growth is caused by differentiation and elongation.

## Cell Organisation and the Circulatory System
Cells, in multicellular organisms are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems.

A tissue is a group of similar cells that work together to do a particular job.

An organ is a group of different tissues that work together to do a particular job.

An organ system is a group of organs working together to do a particular job.

#### The Heart
* The heart has __4__ chambers and __4__ major blood vessels.
* The *right* atrium receives deoxygenated blood (from body) via the vena cava.
* The blood (deoxygenated) then travels to the right ventricle and then to the lungs.
* The *left* atrium receives oxygenated blood (from lungs) via the pulmonary vein.
* The oxygenated blood is then pumped round the entire body via the aorta.

* Valves prevent back-flow of blood.


#### The Blood

**Red Blood Cells** carry oxygen in the blood. They have a unique shape which gives them a large surface area so that they can carry plenty of oxygen. They don't have a nucleus.

**White Blood Cells** defend against disease. They can change shape to consume unwelcome microorganisms. They produce antibodies to fight microorganisms and antitoxins to neutralise toxins produced by microorganisms.

**Platelets** are small fragments of cells which help to create blood clots at a wound.

**Plasma** contains the "other stuff" found in the blood like glucose, urea, hormones etc. and also transports water and carbon dioxide.

#### Blood Vessels
There are three types of blood vessels
1. **Arteries** - carry blood away from the heart and to the body.
   They have thick walls and carry the blood at high pressure.
2. **Veins** - carry blood to the heart and away from the body.
   They have thin walls and carry the blood at low pressure.
3. **Capillaries** - involved in the exchange of materials with tissues. They have permeable walls so materials can diffuse into and out of cells.

## The Digestive System and Enzymes
Digestion is the breakdown food into soluble products to be absorbed by the body.

The breakdown of food is catalysed by enzymes.
