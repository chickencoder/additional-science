## Energy transfer in reactions
Energy must always be supplied to break bonds.

During chemical reactions, old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. Energy must be supplied to break bonds - so this is an endothermic process. Energy is released when new bonds are formed - so this is an exothermic process.

#### Exothermic reactions - energy is given out
Heat is released in forming bonds.

* Combustion - lots of heat is given off since making new bonds gives out much more energy than it does to break bonds in the fuel.

#### Endothermic reactions - energy is taken in
The energy required to break old bonds in the reactants is greater than the heat energy released when new bonds are formed in the products.

* Photosynthesis - using light energy from the sun to covert carbon dioxide and water into glucose

## Rates of Reaction
The rate of reaction is how quickly the reaction takes place.

###### The rate of reaction depends on 4 things:
  1. Temperature
  2. Concentration (or pressure)
  3. Catalyst
  4. Surface area of a solid

## Collision Theory
Collision theory simply states that the rate of a reaction depends on how often and how hard reacting particles hit one another.

More collisions increased the rate of reaction.

Increasing the temperature increases the speed particles move at which therefore increases the number of collisions.

Increasing the concentration obviously increases the amount of particles in the reaction that can collide which therefore increases the rate of reaction. This is the same for larger surface areas.
