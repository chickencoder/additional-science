## Cells and Microscopy

**All living things are made out of __cells__**

Plant cells and animal cells are different.
#### Animal Cells
1. Nucleus - contains the DNA that controls the cells.
2. Cytoplasm - where chemical reactions take place.
3. Cell Membrane - holds the cell together and controls
what goes in and out.
4. Mitochondria - Where most reactions for respiration
occur.

#### Plant Cells
1. Cell Wall - supports the cells shape and structure.
2. Large vacuole - contains sap (sugar and salts).
3. Chloroplasts - where photosynthesis takes place.

Bacterial cells have **no nucleus** and are a lot smaller than
plant or animal cells.

* They have one long circular chromosome that controls the cell.
* Plasmids are bits of extra DNA. They can contain genes for things
such as drugs resistance which can be passed between bacteria.
:* A flagellum is like a tail which rotate to make the cell move.
* And of course bacteria have a cell wall.

Because they're so small, cells are studied using a microscope.
There are two main types of microscopes:
1. Light microscopes - invented in the 1590s, let us see things such as
nuclei.
2. Electron microscopes - invented in the 1930s, let us see even smaller things, even smaller than plasmids, in greater detail.

## DNA
DNA is a molecule that describes one's characteristics which they have inherited from their parents.

DNA is structured as a double-helix which means it has two strands which are woven together and connected by __base pairs__.

There are 4 different possible bases which make up the DNA molecule.
1. Adenine  - A
2. Cytosine - C
3. Guanine  - G
4. Thymine  - T

They bases always come in pairs. A-T and C-G. The pairs are joined together by weak hydrogen bonds.

A **gene** is a section of DNA, made up of a sequence of base pairs to describe the characteristic of a certain **protein**.

## Protein Synthesis
"Your DNA is essentially a long list of instructions on how to make all the proteins in your body."

Cells create proteins by combining **amino acids** together.

There are only __20__ amino acids used to create **every single** protein in your body.

The order of bases describes which order to put the amino acids together.

Every 3 bases codes for a particular amino acid.

(This next part is really important)

#### How protein synthesis works...
Proteins are made by the *Ribosome*!
* DNA __must__ stay inside the nucleus because it's so big!
* mRNA is used as a messenger between the DNA and the ribosome in the cytoplasm.
* mRNA is a single strand.

The process...
1. Transcription - The DNA is *unzipped* into single strands.
The DNA is used as a template for the mRNA.
2. Next the mRNA moves out of the nucleus and joins the ribosome.
3. Amino acids that match the mRNA are brought to the ribosome by molecules
called tRNA.
4. Translation - The ribosome's job is to stick amino acids together in a
long chain called a *polypeptide* which is a protein. This follows the pattern of triplet bases
in the mRNA.

#### Mutations
A mutation is a mistake or change in an organism's DNA base sequence. This
could affect the sequence the amino acids, which in turn can affect the shape
and function of a protein.

However, mutations can be useful - especially if it means that some organisms
may be more resistant to disease for example.

## The wonderful world of *Enzymes*
Enzymes are catalysts meaning they can increase the speed of useful chemical
reactions in living organisms.

*A __catalyst__ is a substance which increases the speed of a reaction
without being CHANGED or USED UP in the reaction.*

Enzymes are **proteins**. Enzymes are used in digestion, for example, to help
digest different food molecules.

Chemical reactions usually mean splitting things up or joining things together.
A substrate is a molecule changed in a reaction.

Enzymes have *"active sites"* which is where it will join to a substrate to
increase the rate of reaction.

Enzymes have a optimum temperature which they're most active at. The normal
optimum temperature for most human enzymes in 37*C. Which is the same temperature
of our bodies!

Not only are enzymes fussy on what temperature they are, they also demand
the right pH level. Similar to temperature, if the pH is too low or too high,
the enzyme will not work effectively or even at all.

## The Human Genome
"The idea was to map the entire 25,000 (roughly) human genes!"

DNA is made up of around 25,000 genes which are curled up into 23 chromosomes.

###### Positives
1. Predict and prevent disease.
2. Develop new medicines.
3. Accurate diagnoses
4. Improve forensic science.

###### Negatives
1. Increased stress - People can find out their risks of certain disease.
2. Discrimination by employers

## Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is using enzymes to "cut and paste" (ctrl-x & ctrl-p) genes.

###### The process
1. Useful genes are "cut" from a chromosome using enzymes.
2. Enzymes then cut a hole in another chromosome and insert the "useful" gene.
3. The result is a *genetically modified* (GM) organism.

Genetic modification can be used to...
* Reduce vitamin A deficiency
* Produce human insulin
* Increase crop yield

However it's rather controversial...

Some people are worried that they will develop allergies. There is also little
known about the longterm effects of consuming GM food.

## Mitosis
Mitosis makes new cells for growth and repair in your body.
*( As Dr. Ruffel says.. "If you want to grow another toe.. mitosis." )*

Human body cells are *diploid* meaning that each chromosome in part of a pair.
This is because one comes from your mother and the other from your father.

__Mitosis results in two identical cells__
1. Once the cell is told to divide, it duplicates it DNA. Each strand is in an
X shape and each arm of the strand is identical to the other.
2. The cell fibres then pull the chromosomes apart.
3. The two arms of each part, now torn apart, go to either end of the cell.
4. Membranes form over each set of chromosomes. These become the nueclei.
5. The cytoplasm finally divides and two separate cells are left.

## Meiosis
Meiosis involves two divisions and produces non-identical cells from two gametes.

Gametes are 'sex cells'. They're called *ova* in females and *sperm* in males.

Unlike the diploid cells used in Mitosis, Meiosis uses haploid cells which only
contain half as many chromosomes. For example, human body cells have 46 chromosomes
each where gametes only have 26. This is because to produce body cells, a male
and female gamete must fuse.

###### The process...
1. Like mitosis, the DNA inside each cell is duplicated.
2. The cell then divdes in two, splitting the original DNA from the copied.
3. Each new cell will have one copy of each chromosome. Some of the mother's and
some of the father's chromsomes go into each cell.
4. Mixing up the alleles in this way creates *variation*.
5. The cells split again once torn apart so that four *haploid* gametes, each with
a single set of chromosomes in it.

## Cloning mammals
Cloning is a type of asexual reproduction. It produces cells that are identical
(genetically speaking) to its original cell.

###### The process...
1. Remove the nucleus from an unfertilised egg cell.
2. Take the nucleus from an adult body cell (e.g. a skin cell)
3. The cell is then electrocuted which forces the cell to start dividing by
meiosis.
4. The cell is then planted into an adult female who acts as a surrogate.

This process was used to create dolly - the famous cloned sheep.

Cloning is useful for...
* producing organs for transplants when there is a shortage of donars.
* protecting and preserving endangered animals.

There are a *many* issues with cloning..
1. Cloning mammals reduces the __"gene pool"__ meaning there is a smaller
variety alleles in a population. Therefore if the population becomes too
similar, a disease could easily wipe out the entire group.
2. Clones may not necessarily live as long.
3. The cloning process often fails meaning large amounts of mammals with
health issues or genetic defects are created.

## Stem Cells
An *embryonic stem cell* can turn into __any__ type of cell.

A fertilised egg will divide, by meiosis, to produce a bundle of cells - the
embryo of a new organism. These cells all start off as the same - embyronic stem
cells. These cells can either divide to create more stem cells or they can become
a specialised type of cell (e.g. A red blood cell).

The process of a stem cell become a specialised cell is known as __differentiation__.
Most animals loose the ability to differentiate their cells but many plants do not.

Being so versitile means that stem cells can be used to cure certain diseases.
In some cases doctors and scientists can use stem cells from embryos to replace
damaged cells in other body cells. __THIS IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL!__
