## Properties of metals
Metals are on the *left* of the periodic table. Most elements are metals. Transition metals are found in the middle of the periodic table.

Metals are good conductors. Metals are also rather *malleable* - this means they can be bent or hammered into different shapes.

Most metals are *transition metals* which means they have..
1. High melting points
2. Form colourful compounds (which can be used in hair dye).

Metal's properties are defined by their **structure**. Metals consist of a regular arrangement of atoms held together by *metalic bonds*.

Metalic bonds give metals giant structures of positive ions and free electrons. Metalic bonds delocalise the outer electron(s) so they can move freely and conduct electricity.

This large structure allows layers of atoms to slide over one another allowing metals to be shaped.

## Group 1 - Alkali Metals
All alkali metals have *one* electron in their outer shell. These include...
* Lithium
* Sodium
* Potassium
* Rubidium
* Caesium
* Francium

These metals are soft and can be cut with a knife and they have low melting points.

When lithium, sodium or potassium are put in water, they react vigorously to form hydroxides. The reaction makes an alkali solution.

The higher the atomic number, the more reactive the metal in group 1.

**Reactions with water produce hydrogen gas** - this is why there is fizzing. Hydrogen gas can be tested for using the lit-splint method. Simply take a lit splint and apply it to the gas. If you hear a "squeeky pop" then hydrogen is present.

## Group 7 - The Halogens
The halogens all have **7** electrons in their outer shell. These include...
  * Chlorine
  * Bromine
  * Iodine

Halogens react with most metals to produce salts called metal halides.

**2Al + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> -> 2AlCl<sub>3</sub>**

Halogens can react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides
Hydrogen halides are soluble.

## Group 0 - The Noble Gases
Group 0 elements gases are all inert, colourless gases.
Inert meaning they don't react with much at all. This is because they have full outer shells.

Noble gases are also non-flammable and are hard to observe.

Argon is used in filament lamps to prevent the hot filament from burning away. Helium is used in balloons.
