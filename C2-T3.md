Covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electrons. This method means that both atoms feel as though they both have full outer shells.

## Covalent Substances
There are two types of covalent substances
1. Simple molecular
2. Giant molecular

##### Simple Molecular Covalent Substances
* Strong bonds form small molecules with two or more atoms
* Attraction between atoms is very weak
* Inter-molecular forces are very weak so bonds are easily broken and have low melting and boiling points.
* Most are gases or liquids at room temperature

#### Giant Molecular Covalent Substances
* Similar to ionic lattices except there are no charged particles
* All atoms are bonded by strong bonds
* Very high boiling and melting points
* Apart from graphite, they don't conduct electricity
* Usually insoluble
* Examples include diamond, graphite

Graphite is in sheets or layers. These can be broken off easily. Each atom only has 3 bonds leaving a 4th electron free. This is why graphite can conduct electricity.

## Separation Techniques
Some liquid mixtures are **immiscible** and some are **miscable**.

#### Separating Immiscible Liquids
The pour the liquid into a separating funnel and wait for the denser
liquid to fall to the bottom and for the liquids to separate. Then simply pour out the liquids individually.

#### Separating Miscable Liquids
These liquids must be separated using fractional distillation. The liquids must be cooled and then heated first to the lower of the two's boiling temperating. Once the first liquid has been collected you can increase the temperature and then boil the second.

## Chromatography
Chromatography is used to identify substances.

###### The Process
1. Put dots of each mixture along a line on filter paper.
2. Fill a beaker with a solvent, such as ethanol or water, to the point where the strip of paper will start absorbing the solvent.
3. Wait for the water to separate the dots and watch it climb the paper.

You can calculate the R<sub>f</sub> value by dividing the distance the mixture traveled by the distance the solvent traveled. This is used in the food industry and forensic science to help scientists identify different solutions and mixtures.
